Email-agent is an agent that helps you navigate through your emails using the Telegram Bot API. You can ask for unread messages, mark them as read, and see a short message overview for each user. Additionally, you can request specific help from the agent when you need to handle your responses quickly.

To run the application, you need to configure all **keys.py** file for each server and use **docker-compose** for the starting of the app.
